# Mural Trace

**Mural Trace** is a spatial experience designed for Apple Vision Pro. It allows users to trace art and designs onto real-world walls, using AR passthrough to guide users line by line. Whether for home decoration, personalized murals, or interactive learning spaces.

## Features

- **Wall Detection**: Automatically identifies walls in your environment using Vision Pro's AR plane detection.
- **Step-by-Step Tracing**: Guides users through a step-by-step process of tracing art onto their walls.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity PolySpatial**: For building immersive 3D and spatial experiences.
- **AR Plane Detection**: Used to identify and map real-world walls.
- **Vision Pro Passthrough**: Projects designs onto physical walls, blending the digital and physical worlds seamlessly.
- **Mesh-Based Line Renderer**: Custom solution for smooth line rendering, since the Vision Pro platform lacks native support for line rendering.

## How It Works

1. **Launch the App**: The app will detect your wall and position the selected art in the center.
2. **Start Tracing**: Follow the step-by-step guides to trace the design on your wall. The app provides clear visual cues for each line.
